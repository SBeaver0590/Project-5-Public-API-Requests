# Project 5 Public API Requests
 

### Description 

This Project is gathering employee information from a random employee directory. I requested a JSON object and parsed 
through it in order to display image, name, address ,etc per employee.


### How Solved

The user information was pulled from the API. I used my HTML to dynamically input the information onto each modal as 
well as their modal card pop-up.



### Extra Credit Features

I added a background-color to the body as well as each modal card. Created a search bar for the directory. I also provided next/previous buttons for the user to toggle back and forward through the list.
Thank you for taking time to visit my code. HAPPY CODING!
